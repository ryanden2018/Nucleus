* As a user, I would like to view posts for a group or by a user.

Minimal viable product

* Posts, Users (day 0)

Some views

* Forms (create posts, edit posts, create groups, edit groups). 
* View posts of a group (sorted by timestamp and # likes).
* View posts on user timeline (sorted by timestamp). Public vs friends distinction.
* Friends
* Who liked a post

Intro page: log in (or create account & log in). Once logged in, see launchpad
which displays posts by your friends and posts in groups you are subscribed to.
Launchpad show groups you are subscribed to & list of your friends, and button to
create new post. Clicking on a post shows content and plus/minus posts.
Group owner can remove post from the group (deletes the association).
